## Before you begin

- **Access:** vCenter read-only minimum; Administrator role for remediation steps
- **Timing:** safe to run during business hours unless a step is marked ⚠ (causes interruption)
- **Dependencies:** no active upgrades or migrations on the same infrastructure
- **Logging:** capture command output — paste into the change record on completion
