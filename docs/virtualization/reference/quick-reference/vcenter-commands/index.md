## Check Uptime

## Check Certificate Status

Access VAMI at `https://<vcenter>:5480` → **Certificate Management**

## When Not to Restart Services

- If disk partitions are full — free space first
- If a restore is needed — restarting services will not fix a corrupt database
- During active vMotion or vSAN resync operations without change approval

## Escalation

If services do not recover after a restart, collect a support bundle from VAMI and open a VMware support case.
