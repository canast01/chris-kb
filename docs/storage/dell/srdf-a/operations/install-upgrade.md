# SRDF/A — Install & Upgrade
![SRDF/A — Install & Upgrade](../../../../assets/storage-dell-srdf-a-operations-install-upgrade.svg)

```bash
# Step 1 — Suspend SRDF/A replication on the device group
symrdf -g <dgname> -sid <r1_sid> suspend -noprompt

# Step 2 — Verify pair state is Suspended
symrdf -g <dgname> -sid <r1_sid> query

# Step 3 — Perform NDU on source array (via Unisphere or Dell support)
# NDU on PowerMax is non-disruptive to host I/O — suspension is only for SRDF/A cycle management

# Step 4 — Perform NDU on target array

# Step 5 — Resume SRDF/A replication
symrdf -g <dgname> -sid <r1_sid> resume -noprompt

# Step 6 — Verify pair state returns to Consistent
symrdf -g <dgname> -sid <r1_sid> query
# Wait for SyncInProg → Consistent transition before closing the change window
```

## Before you begin

- **Access:** Storage admin credentials (cluster admin or equivalent)
- **Timing:** safe to run during business hours unless a step is marked ⚠ (causes interruption)
- **Dependencies:** no active upgrades or migrations on the same infrastructure
- **Logging:** capture command output — paste into the change record on completion

---

---

## Verify

- Confirm the operation completed without errors in the log or management UI
- Verify the expected state change is visible (service running, object created, config applied)
- Document the outcome in the change record
