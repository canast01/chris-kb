# APEX Storage as a Service — Common Issues

> Part of the [APEX Storage as a Service](../../) reference.

---

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Infrastructure health warning in APEX Console | On-premises hardware fault or connectivity loss from Secure Connect Gateway | Check SCG connectivity; review hardware alerts on the underlying platform (PowerStore/PowerScale/PowerFlex) |
| Burst capacity charges unexpected | Workload growth or snapshot/backup accumulation pushing usage above committed tier | Review consumed capacity trend in APEX Console; identify growth sources; raise committed tier if sustained |
| APEX Console shows infrastructure as offline | Secure Connect Gateway appliance down or network path to Dell blocked | Check SCG appliance health and outbound HTTPS connectivity on port 443 to Dell APEX endpoints |
| Capacity request delayed | Service request not raised in APEX Console, or SLA window not yet elapsed | Raise a capacity increase request via APEX Console; review the contracted SLA response time |
| Billing discrepancy | Consumed capacity reported differently between on-premises platform and APEX Console | Allow 24 hours for telemetry sync; open a support case via APEX Console if discrepancy persists |
