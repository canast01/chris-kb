## Before you begin

- **Access:** Admin credentials on all affected systems
- **Timing:** safe to run during business hours unless a step is marked ⚠ (causes interruption)
- **Dependencies:** no active upgrades or migrations on the same infrastructure
- **Logging:** capture command output — paste into the change record on completion

---

---

## Verify

- Confirm the operation completed without errors in the log or management UI
- Verify the expected state change is visible (service running, object created, config applied)
- Document the outcome in the change record
